        Get started by filling out the inputs with a skill. The skill notation
        is as following:
      </p>
      <p>
        {
          "<number of rotations> <number of twists seperated by space> <position>"
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        A valid skill would be "12 - - 3 V" or "8 1 2 V"{" "}
        {"(Piked triff rudy and Piked full in half out"}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
